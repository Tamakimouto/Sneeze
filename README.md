# Sneeze
Sneeze is a mobile based social media platform similar to Twitter in that
people can leave short messages, however Sneeze will not display more than
3 “sneezes” at a time. The reason being that 2-3 is the number of average
consecutive sneezes that people do. There is neither a “follow” system nor
a “hashtag” syntax.

Sneezes are only kept around for 30 minutes; up to 3 Sneezes will be displayed
at a time, selected from the pool of all the sneezes in the world.
